    abstract = { The increasing use of small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in managed and often contested airspace has raised public safety concerns, creating a need to proactively provide risk assessment ahead of flight. Such assessments require clear reasoning and supporting evidence to demonstrate the safety of the intended flight. In this paper, we first present an initial analysis of incident reports from three different international databases. We find that for the US-based database that user error is the predominant cause of incidents, but for the UK-based database, mechanical failure is more frequently reported. We then present SafeCert, a prototype software tool developed to assist sUAS operators by automatically analyzing and visualizing the safety-related evidence associated with an upcoming flight. SafeCert takes as input a feature model that captures operational variabilities, such as drone model and environmental conditions, and a parameterized safety argument representing acceptable justifications for flight safety. Next, based on the operatorâ€™s responses to a dynamically generated set of flight-specific questions, SafeCert compares these parameters against the safety argument and outputs a color-coded visualization of a structured safety argument diagram. We believe our database analysis can be leveraged to refine the questions, feature model, and safety arguments in SafeCert. }

    abstract = { This work presents our progress for automating on-entry decisions for small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) that request access to UTM-managed flight zones. These decisions consider current environmental conditions, and sUAS and operator reputations and credentials. Reputations are established dynamically over time from flight histories of successful or problematic flights within UTM zones, while credentials certify capabilities for operating in current environmental conditions including airworthiness of the drone, sensing and maneuvering capabilities, and alignment with the current environmental conditions and flight plans. In this paper, we describe these factors, present a cloud-based architecture for supporting this approach across diverse sUAS, and report on preliminary proof-of-concept experiments conducted in simulation. }
